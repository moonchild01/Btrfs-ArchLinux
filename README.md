# Btrfs on ARCH-LINUX(no liability in case of data loss)

##### this process allows us to change filesystems even if we have other partitions on our ssd.

[Pros and Cons of Using Btrfs Filesystem in Linux](https://itsfoss.com/btrfs/)

1. in case you would like to use Arch vanilla you can execute the first commands concerning the creation of the subvolumes and then start the clean installation.

2. if instead you want to use an Arch-based distro, after creating the subvolumes you can start the installation of the latter via the graphical interface and through a bug force the assignment of BTRFS as filesystem (you have to assign and uncheck the box several times partition on which we want to install and after 2-3 attempts the game is done)

once the installation has been successful you can start installing the packages needed to manage the snapshots.

HAVE FUN!!
